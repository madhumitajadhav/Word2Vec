# Word2Vec
Word2Vec model implementation as given in the paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf

Here are the resources I used to build this notebook. 

1. A really good conceptual overview of Word2Vec from Chris McCormick

2. First Word2Vec paper from Mikolov et al.

3. Neural Information Processing Systems, paper with improvements for Word2Vec also from Mikolov et al.
