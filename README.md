# Word2Vec
Word2Vec model implementation from scratch.
Which is referred from original paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf

Here are the resources I used to build this notebook. I suggest reading these either beforehand or while you're working on this material.
A really good conceptual overview of Word2Vec from Chris McCormick
First Word2Vec paper from Mikolov et al.
Neural Information Processing Systems, paper with improvements for Word2Vec also from Mikolov et al.
